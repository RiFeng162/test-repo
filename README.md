This branch is used to re-do the beginner's tutorial practice, the tutorial souce is https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
The step I did is : 
  1. create a branch off master and call it readme-edit
  2. re-edit the readme file, and commit changes [commit is the changes saving in Github, usually along with the message to tell why this change happens]
